<h2>Patch Notes - 19/05/2025</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is now a third level of warps that lets you click any spot on the world map to teleport there.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where Azuregos respawn time was not reduced few patches ago.</li>
  <li>Lethality perk will no longer reset itself when you change targets or hit a secondary target with Blade Flurry.</li>
  <li>Fixed some bugs with combat rogue perk set (2) bonus where it would sometimes repeat the abilities with more combo points than it was supposed to.</li>
  <li>Annoy-o-Tron can be used while mounted.</li>
  <li>Sacred Shield has infinite duration when cast on yourself.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where Misery Aura did not look selected in the aura bar when you had it active.</li>
  <li>Judgement of Ruin specifically can proc Judgements of the Wise if you detonated any marks. This is an exception and none of the other damaging Judgement related procs still apply.</li>
  <li>Trial of Champion will now skip jousting if you have at least 30 speed buff and enabled dungeon event speedup. This will also let you talk to the announcer without having to use mount.</li>
  <li>Trial of Champion will notify you of missing lance if you try to use mount without one.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where Trample could be canceled in Trial of Champion.</li>
  <li>ICC teleporters will no longer stun you and can be used while mounted.</li>
  <li>Adjusted Mimiron's script to hopefully reduce the chance of him bugging at end.</li>
  <li>Little zombies in Culling of Stratholme will no longer try to aggro Arthas, hopefully reduces the amount of issues that happen when player doesn't go to Arthas after killing 2nd boss.</li>
</ul>
