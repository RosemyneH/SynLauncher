<h2>Patch Notes - 16/05/2025</h2>
<h3>New client patch: v38</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug where <strong>Cheer: Swiftness</strong> was always only copying rank 1 versions of the pet abilities, and this also caused some other pet aspects to not consider those as pet abilities.</li>
  <li>Quests that require items that go in resource bank can now be completed directly from the resource bank without having to withdraw them.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where combo points didn't show up for dual class characters.</li>
  <li>You can equip bind-on-equip items in combat.</li>
  <li>Realmlist is now automatically set when starting from WoWExt (without modifying the actual realmlist file).</li>
  <li>Mark of Ruin is no longer considered a DoT if Sealed Fate perk is taken. This allows it to work with Beacon of Darkness.</li>
  <li>Annoy-o-Tron is now a spell.</li>
  <li>WotLK mythics now give more attune XP than TBC mythics.</li>
  <li>patch notes are now fetched from GitHub.</li>
